# Overview

I wanted to get more comfortable making simple games and working with graphics and input in Python. This project is a basic version of Flappy Bird using the Arcade library. You press the spacebar to make the bird flap upward, and the goal is to fly through gaps between moving pipes without crashing.

The main reason I built this was to practice game loops, sprites, collisions, and just to have something fun to show. I also wanted something my kids could test out and enjoy.
